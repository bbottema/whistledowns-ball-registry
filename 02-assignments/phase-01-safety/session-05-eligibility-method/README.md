# Session 05 – Eligibility Method

## Goal

Write a method that encodes Lady Whistledown's eligibility rules.

## What You'll Do

1. Create an `isEligible` method that checks age and family name
2. Test it with different inputs

## How to Run It

1. Open `S05_EligibilityMethod.java`
2. Right-click and run it

## Expected Output

```
true
false
false
false
```

## If You Get Stuck

**"Cannot resolve symbol"**
- Check the spelling of your method name
- Make sure parameters match when calling

**Logic errors**
- Age must be >= 18
- Family name must not be null or blank

## Coach Notes

Methods let you package logic and reuse it. This is your first reusable validation function.

Before running, try predicting the output. This builds test intuition: what should happen given these inputs?
