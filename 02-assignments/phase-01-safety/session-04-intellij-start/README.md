# Session 04 – IntelliJ Start

## Goal

Get comfortable with the main method and reading IntelliJ's error messages.

## What You'll Do

1. Run a simple "start button" file
2. Practice fixing a controlled compile error

## How to Run It

1. Open `S04_StartButton.java`
2. Right-click and run it

## Expected Output

```
Hello tester
```

## Controlled Error Practice

1. Remove a semicolon from the println statement
2. Observe the red underline
3. Hover over it or press Alt+Enter
4. Read the suggestion
5. Add the semicolon back

## If You Get Stuck

**"Cannot find or load main class"**
- Make sure your class name matches the file name
- Check that you're in the correct directory

## Coach Notes

The main method is just the "start button" for your program. Don't worry about `static` or `String[] args` yet. They're required Java ceremony.

Errors feel like guidance when you practice reading them in a safe environment. IntelliJ is helping you, not judging you.
