// Session 01 - Java basics in the JShell Sandbox

/*
 * So, here we are! This is the beginning of your first session. Make sure you read the README.md first.
 *
 * This session is about learning how to define a variable that can hold different types of data.
 *
 * In Java, everything that can hold or give a value is always preceded by a type. You can say it out loud the same way you declare a variable:
 * "I'm declaring an 'integer' named 'age' and I'm giving it the value '21'" -> integer age = 21
 *
 * There are a few different types of data that variables can hold, such as integers, strings, and booleans. Don't worry about all the other types yet; in fact, with these three types
 * you can already create everything you need to create a program. You can use integers to represent numbers, strings to represent text, and booleans to represent true/false values.

// Copy these snippets into the JShell Console (Tools -> JShell Console...)
// Type or paste them one at a time and observe the output

// TODO: Declare three variables
// int age = 21;
// String family = "Bridgerton";
// boolean invited = true;

// TODO: Print each variable
// System.out.println(age);
// System.out.println(family);
// System.out.println(invited);

// TODO: Trigger a controlled exception (see what happens!)
// throw new RuntimeException("Lady Whistledown disapproves.");

// OPTIONAL: Try this to see a parsing error
// Integer.parseInt("not-a-number");
