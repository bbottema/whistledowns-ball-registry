# Bridgerton Social Registry Warmup

A beginner-friendly Java warmup project for testers preparing for a Java testing course.

## What This Is

Lady Whistledown needs help managing the social registry for the season's ball.

You'll build a system that determines who may attend based on various etiquette rules. This project introduces Java fundamentals in gentle steps, and each phase builds on the previous one; nothing appears without preparation.

## What This Is Not

This is not a memorization exercise.

You are not expected to remember every keyword, every syntax rule, or every pattern.  
You are expected to experiment, run code, read output, and grow comfortable. Confusion at first exposure is normal. Repetition creates clarity.

You can always:
- re-run a session
- look at earlier assignments
- compare with the solutions
- take small steps

This project is a safe sandbox. Mistakes are expected here.

## Getting Started

This warmup uses modern Java and requires **Java 21 or higher**.

In IntelliJ: set **Project SDK** to your installed JDK (21+). If you don't have one yet, IntelliJ can download it for you. You can manage all this in **File > Project Structure > Project**.

### Step 1: Install IntelliJ IDEA

Download and install **IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition** (it's free). When you first open it, IntelliJ will offer to download Java for you if you don't have it. Let it do that.

### Step 2: Open This Project

**Preferred route (recommended): clone the repository**

1. Launch IntelliJ
2. Click **Get from VCS** (or **Clone Repository**)
3. Paste the Git URL:
   - `https://github.com/bbottema/whistledowns-ball-registry.git`
4. Choose a local folder and click **Clone**
5. If prompted to trust the project, click **Trust Project**

**Alternative route (if you downloaded a ZIP or already have the folder): open the project folder**

1. Launch IntelliJ
2. Click **Open**
3. Navigate to the project folder and click **Open**
4. If prompted to trust the project, click **Trust Project**

### First Run

Ready to start? Here's what to do:

1. In the Project view (left side), open: `02-assignments/phase-01-first-season/session-01-the-season-begins`
2. Open the `S01_Assignment.java` file
3. Read the session `README.md` for instructions
4. Click the green ▶ run button to run the program

Note: in Session 01 you'll intentionally crash the program once. Seeing output, then a crash, then a stack trace is expected here — treat it like a useful test failure report. 
Seeing a stack trace is part of learning Java — it shows you exactly where something happened.

Each of the three main folders (clean-start, assignments, solutions) contains the same phase structure:

## Project Structure

This project has four main folders:

### 00-coach-material
Contains coaching materials and reference documents. This is optional - students can work through the project independently, but if a coach is guiding the sessions, this folder provides:
- **03. Progress Tracker.md**: Printable template to fill in for students to keep track during the course
- **04. Java Cheat Sheet.md**: One-page printable reference of Java fundamentals covered in this warmup

### 01-clean-start
Contains starter files with TODO comments and hints. All code compiles but logic needs to be implemented. Use this as a reference or to start fresh. Don't modify anything in this folder.

### 02-assignments
**This is your working directory.** Make all your edits here. Starts identical to clean-start. This folder is marked as the Sources Root in IntelliJ.

### 03-solutions
Contains fully implemented solutions. Use these to check your work or get unstuck. All code here compiles and runs correctly.

## Phases Overview

Each of the three folders contains identical phase structure:

- **Phase 01 – First Season** (Sessions 1-5): Variables, strings, decisions, loops, and basic methods
- **Phase 02 – The Ton** (Sessions 6-8): Classes, interfaces, and orchestration
- **Phase 03 – Whistledown's Verdict** (Sessions 9-10): Assertions and JUnit preview
    - **Note:** This concludes the core basics, and you can choose to stop here
- **Phase 04 – Season of Refinement** (Sessions 11-18, optional): 
  - Maps, diagnostics, test harnesses, structured results, CSV data loading, parameterized testing, formatted reports, and statistics
  - You can read more about Phase 04 in /02-assignments/phase-04-season-of-refinement/README.md

## How to Run a Session

1. Navigate to `02-assignments/phase-XX/session-YY/`
2. Open the Java file(s) in that session
3. Read the session `README.md` for guidance
4. Run the session program:
   - Click the green ▶ next to `main(...)`, or
   - Right-click the file and choose **Run**
5. Observe output and compare to the "success" section

## How to Reset a Session

If you want to start a session over:

1. Copy the files from `01-clean-start/phase-XX/session-YY/`
2. Paste into `02-assignments/phase-XX/session-YY/`
3. Replace the existing files

## Coach Rule

**Stop after a win.**

When your code runs and produces the expected output, stop. You're done. Don't chase perfection. Don't add extra features. Celebrate the green output and move on.

## Progress Tracking

See `PROGRESS.md` for a checklist of all sessions. Mark them off as you complete them.

## Technical Notes

- Plain Java project (no build tools needed, everything is inside IntelliJ)
- Each session folder is self-contained
- No external libraries required

## Getting Help

Each session has a README.md with:
- Goal
- Steps to follow
- Expected output
- Common errors and fixes
- Coaching notes

If you're stuck for more than 10 minutes, check the solution in `03-solutions` or take a break. Errors are feedback, not judgment.
