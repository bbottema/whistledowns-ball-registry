# Session 09 – Mini Asserts

## Goal

Build a simple assertion library and use it to test the Ball registry.

## What You'll Do

1. Create MiniAsserts with assertTrue and assertEquals
2. Use these assertions to test the Ball
3. Practice triggering a controlled assertion failure

## How to Run It

1. Open all Java files in this session
2. Right-click `S09_Demo.java` and run it

## Expected Output

```
All checks passed
```

## Controlled Failure Practice

After seeing success, flip one assertion condition to make it fail. Read the error message. Then fix it back.

## If You Get Stuck

**AssertionError thrown**
- This is expected if a check fails
- Read the message to understand what failed

## Coach Notes

Assertions are how tests verify expectations. When reality doesn't match expectations, the test fails loudly.

This controlled failure practice builds confidence: failing tests are not scary; they're informative.
