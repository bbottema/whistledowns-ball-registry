# Session 10 – JUnit Preview

## Goal

See what JUnit tests look like without diving deep into setup.

## What You'll Do

1. Look at a JUnit test structure
2. Understand @Test annotation
3. See built-in assertions

## How to Run It

**Note:** This session is a preview only. JUnit setup is not included in this warmup project. This file shows you what JUnit looks like so you recognize it in your course.

## What to Notice

- `@Test` marks a method as a test
- Method names describe what's being tested
- Assertions are built into JUnit
- Each test method runs independently

## If You Get Stuck

This session is for reading and understanding, not for running. You'll set up JUnit properly in your course.

## Coach Notes

JUnit is the industry-standard testing framework for Java. You've already built the concepts (arrange, act, assert). JUnit just provides the professional tooling.

When you see JUnit in your course, you'll recognize: "I already understand what this does."
