# Session 03 – Decisions & Loops

## Goal

Use if/else statements and loops to evaluate multiple test cases.

## What You'll Do

1. Write a simple if/else rule
2. Loop over an array of ages
3. Loop over a list of family names

## How to Run It

1. Open `S03_DecisionsLoops.java`
2. Right-click and run it

## Expected Output

- "Eligible" or "Not eligible" for a single age
- Multiple lines showing age → eligibility result
- Multiple lines showing family name → respectable result

## If You Get Stuck

**Syntax error in for loop**
- For arrays: `for (int a : ages) { ... }`
- For lists: `for (String f : families) { ... }`

**Forgot import**
- Add `import java.util.List;` at the top

## Coach Notes

Loops let you run the same check on multiple test cases. This is the foundation of data-driven testing.

You're building test-thinking patterns: given multiple inputs, what are the expected outcomes?
