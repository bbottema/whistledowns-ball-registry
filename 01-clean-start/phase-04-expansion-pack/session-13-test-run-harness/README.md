# Session 13 – Test Run Harness

## Goal

Create an automation-style test harness that arranges data, runs checks, and reports results.

## What You'll Do

1. Create a RegistryTestRun class
2. Arrange test data (reputations, guests)
3. Assert expected outcomes
4. Report success

## How to Run It

1. Open `S13_RegistryTestRun.java`
2. Right-click and run it

## Expected Output

```
Registry checks: PASS
```

## If You Get Stuck

**Assertion fails**
- Check your test data matches expectations
- Review the logic in your rules

## Coach Notes

This is the shape of automated test runs: Arrange → Act → Assert → Report.

You've built all the pieces: data structures, rules, orchestration, assertions, and now a harness that ties it together. This is test automation thinking.

Congratulations! You've completed the warmup. You're ready for your course.
