# Session 01 – Sandbox Java

## Goal

Get comfortable running simple Java code, seeing output, and observing controlled errors.

## What You'll Do

1. Declare variables and print them
2. Trigger a controlled runtime exception (safe practice)
3. Optionally trigger a parsing error

## How to Run It

1. Open `S01_Sandbox.java`
2. Right-click inside the file
3. Select "Run S01_Sandbox.main()"

## Expected Output

You should see:
- Three printed values (age, family name, invited status)
- A RuntimeException with Lady Whistledown's message

## If You Get Stuck

**Error: "Cannot find symbol"**
- Check spelling and semicolons

**Error: "Main method not found"**
- Make sure you have `public static void main(String[] args)`

## Coach Notes

This session is about feeling safe with errors. Exceptions are information, not failure. You're learning to read what Java tells you.

Stop after you see the output and the exception. That's a win.
